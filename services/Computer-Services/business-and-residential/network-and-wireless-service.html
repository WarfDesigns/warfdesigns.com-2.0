        <h3>Why is my Wi-Fi fast in one room but slow in another?</h3>
        <p>Walls, distance, and interference from neighboring networks can weaken your signal. We measure and correct these issues with placement, channels, and access points.</p>

        <h3>Do I need mesh Wi-Fi?</h3>
        <p>If you have dead zones or a larger multi-story home, mesh or additional access points often deliver the best coverage and stability.</p>

        <h3>Can you secure my network for guests and smart devices?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We set up guest networks, isolate IoT devices, enforce strong encryption, and implement DNS/web filtering if desired.</p>

        <h3>Will you work with my existing ISP equipment?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. We can optimize what you have or recommend better hardware for your goals and budget.</p>
