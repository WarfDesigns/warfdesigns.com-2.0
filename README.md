Overview:

A Code: You capstone project utilizing 3rd party API while also highlighting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities.

Project Overview:

This is a redesign of my current WordPress website. I have always preferred a custom built site with my own code; just never got around to actually having the time to do so. This website will display all my services, have forms for customers to calculate pricing and to contact me. Using Captcha API to keep the contact form secure. It will also feature a app-like menu at the bottom of the screen for mobile devices, and use javascript to use html templates for the headers, footers, and app-menu to be located on every page of the website.

Future Changes Desired:

Eventually it will have forms for customers to sign contract agreements, forms for appointment schedules, email notifications or sms messages to my phone to notify me, and more. I may integrate stripe eventually and create my own CMS that will do similar actions that WHCMS has. Replace the reviews section with my own so I can stop paying them yearly. Create my own Forms Application, so I can stop paying Formidable Forms yearly.
